#NINE HOLE GOLF

##Game Play

One deck consists of three regulation decks, including jokers, shuffled.
Every player is dealt nine cards each.
Cards are arranged in a 3x3 grid.
The deck sits in the middle of each player.
One card is dealt to the discard pile.
Player to the left of the dealer goes first.
A player draws a card, either from the deck, or the discard.
Player chooses whether to:
	--Replace one of their showing cards with the drawn card, discarding the showing card.
	--Replace one of their turned-down cards with the drawn card, discarding the turned-down card.
	--Discard the drawn card.
Play passes to the left, in the same fashion, until one player has all of their cards face-up. 
Each player gets one more turn, after which, all of their turned-down cards are flipped to showing.

Points are tallied and added to the scorecard.

##Scoring

Every card's points are as follows.

	-- Aces - tens: Face Value. A=1 point, 2=2 points, 3=3 points...
	-- Jacks & Queens: 10 points each.
	-- Kings: Zero points.
	-- Jokers: -2 points. 

####Matching 3 of the same card, either horizontally or vertically creates a 'Dead Row', which makes the score for that row zero points. 


##Winning

The player with the lowest points at the end of nine rounds is the winner.
